Question - Implement basic logic gates using C (AND, OR, NOT). Consider the inputs: 0,1 ,0,1, 1,0, 1,1.

1.Start.
2.Read the inputs for the basic logic gates operation.
3.using the user inputs implement logic gates AND OR NOT
4.when the both inputs high output will be high - for AND Gate
5.when the any one inputs high output will be high - for OR Gate
6.Compliment of inputs 1 to 0,1 to 0 - Not Gate
7.Stop
